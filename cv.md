### CODE

> DESCRIPTION:
Complete the square sum function so that it squares each number passed into it and then sums the results together.
For example, for [1, 2, 2] it should return 9 because 1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 9.

```
function squareSum(numbers){
  return numbers.reduce(function(previousValue, currentValue){
  return previousValue + Math.pow(currentValue, 2);
}, 0);

}
```
